Julie\'s new dog, Singer, turns out to be a better judge of character than she, which is unfortunate because the dog nearly gives away the book\'s ending when he growls warily at Richard Franklin, the new man in Julie\'s life. On the other hand, the pooch loves to be around Mike Harris, Jim\'s best friend, who has grown to love Julie. Richard\'s increasingly bizarre behavior causes Julie to break up with him, and his subsequent stalker tactics make for compelling action, especially when he plots to destroy the budding romance between Julie and Mike. But the writing is lax at best, with multiple point-of-view shifts in the course of one page or even one paragraph. Secondary characters are two-dimensional, such as Pete, the dumb cop who is taken in by the scheming Richard, and Andrea, Julie\'s co-worker at the local hair salon, a low-class broad from the wrong side of the tracks who might as well have \"next victim\" tattooed on her forehead.

Her parents divorce particularly troubles her. She still wishes to have a whole family again, and she thinks that their separation was her fault because of the name she was given. For years the tension has produced a number of varying emotions. It gets worse when Kamala Mami is diagnosed with Alzheimers disease. Maya cant deal with the stress any longer.

While the period of the plot is around the 1950s, the story revolves around the farmers ties with his land and his inability to visualize a life without it-an issue relevant even today. The farmers death could have been forgotten by the village, except for several puzzling incidents that crop up. Myth and reality intertwine to create a folklore around the land and the farmer. \r\n\r\nThis Telugu novella was first published in 1993, during a period when Andhra Pradeshs farmers had begun committing suicide in droves. Many surprising parallels can be drawn to the pressures in agriculture and the farmer in real life and in the novel. This novella introduced what is called (in Telugu literary criticism) as magic realism-mirroring real life and yet making wide departures into the world of lore, mythic representation, and strongly rooted cultural beliefs. Kesava Reddy writes with a strong inflection of his native Rayalaseema dialect. Breaking the tradition of writing in the standard Telugu form as it is spoken and written by people from the coastal districts of Krishna and Guntur, Kesava Reddy along with several other writers began writing in his native dialect-a bold step at that time. The detail in the novel is striking. Kesava Reddy also broke with Telugu literature (which was didactic at that time) to build on detail and cut down on dialogue. His dialogues are sparse and never interfere with the tempo built up in the story.

Bestselling author Ira Trivedi travelled from Shilling in the northeast to Chennai in the south, Konark in the east to Mumbai in the west and over a dozen other cities and towns in order to gain unprecedented insights into changing sexual habits, marriage and love everywhere in the country. The book explores the mating habits of young Indians on college campuses and in offices, examines the new face of Indian pornography and prostitution, probes India\'s gay revolution and delves into history, economics and sociology to try and understand how the nation that gave the world the Kamasutra could have become a closed, repressed society with a shockingly high incidence of rape and violence against women the dark underside to the greater sexual freedom that men and women in our cities have begun to enjoy today. Trivedi goes deep into one of the most enduring institutions of Indian society marriage and investigates how it is faring in modern times. She interviews marriage brokers, astrologers, lawyers, relationship counsellors, \'love commandos\', parents and nervous young brides and grooms, amongst others, to present a nuanced picture of the state of marriage in the country. She discovers that love marriages are skyrocketing and even the age-old arranged marriage is undergoing a transformation. Also on the rise are divorces, extra-marital affairs, open marriages, live-in-relationships and the like. Supporting her eye-opening reportage with hundreds of interviews, detailed research, authoritative published surveys and discussions with experts on various aspects of sexuality and marriage, Trivedi has written a book that is often startling, sometimes controversial, but is always entertaining and original.','http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41j9us4hhnL._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg'),('9788129139559','Gumrah: 11 Short Teen Crime Stories','Ira Trivedi',9,82,304,'Popular Channel V series \'Gumrah: End of Innocence\' has been adapted into a crime book \'Gumrah: 11 Short Teen Crime Stories\' by Ira Trivedi.
